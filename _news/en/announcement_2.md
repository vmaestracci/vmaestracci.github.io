My paper with [Marie Kerjean](https://lipn.univ-paris13.fr/~kerjean/) and [Morgan Rogers](https://lipn.univ-paris13.fr/~rogers/) entitled "Functorial Models of Differential Linear Logic" got accepted at FSCD2025! ⸜(｡˃ ᵕ ˂ )⸝♡ :partying_face:

I would invite anybody interested in reading [A Tangent on Categorical Models of DiLL](https://lipn.univ-paris13.fr/TLLA/2025/abstracts/02-koleilat.pdf) by [Jad Koleilat](https://lipn.univ-paris13.fr/~koleilat/) which is a brilliant improvement over what we started!
